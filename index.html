    <h1>Biography Paragraph </h1>
      <p>My name is Christian Hartupee and I've been attending Lewis and Clark Tech Center, in the computer software development class. So far, we've learned SQL, Linux command prompt, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
      I'm by no means an expert coder, but I've learned a lot and plan to continue to learn more about coding. I'm most comfortable with HTML and CSS coding. 
      I have a great work ethic and drive, In my free time I work on cars, trucks, motorcycles, dirtbikes, ATV's, and lawn mowers. I'm even in the process of restoring and upgrading my 1982 GMC K1500 with the help of my stepfather.</p>
    <h2>Career Aspirations </h2>
      <p>One of my dreams as a kid was to become a video game developer, amoung other things. Eventually starting a video game company to release original games, a lot of games play fairly similary.
    Video games are fun, but there hasn't been a completely original released in awhile. Reboots and spinoff games are fun and all, but after awhile you begin to want something a little different than the rest.</p>
